# Contributing

## Development Workflow

- **Commit guide**: [docs/contributing/COMMIT_GUIDE.md](docs/contributing/COMMIT_GUIDE.md)
- **Push guide**: [docs/contributing/PUSH_GUIDE.md](docs/contributing/PUSH_GUIDE.md)

Root scripts `prepare_commit.sh` and `setup_and_push.sh` are helper scripts for git operations.

## Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Use type hints where appropriate.
- Add tests for new functionality.
- Run `pytest` before committing.
